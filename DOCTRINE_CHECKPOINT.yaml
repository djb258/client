# DOCTRINE CHECKPOINT
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Authority: imo-creator (Constitutional)
# Purpose: Lightweight plan-before-you-build gate for CC (Claude Code / AI agents)
# Enforcement: Pre-commit hook CHECK 11 — blocks commits with missing/stale checkpoints
#
# WHEN TO FILL THIS:
#   Before EVERY coding session. The pre-commit hook rejects commits if this
#   file is missing, stale (>24 hours), or has unfilled fields.
#
# HOW TO FILL THIS:
#   1. Read CC_OPERATIONAL_DIGEST.md (TIER 1 — the field manual)
#   2. Answer each field below based on what you're about to build
#   3. Save this file, then write code and commit
#   Takes ~10 seconds. Not 10 minutes.
#
# STALENESS RULE:
#   This checkpoint expires after 24 hours. If you start a new session,
#   refresh it. This prevents "fill once and coast forever."
